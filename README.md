       %% Prints a single '%' character

       %b Convert the unsigned argument to a binary and print it.

       %u Prints the integer unsigned decimal conversion.

## Compilations:
  You can compile the project "printf" by do the following command:

       gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic * . c (all together) 
       
       
## Examples:
```
       1:) _printf("Number:[%d]\n", 762534);
       2:) _printf("Unsigned:[%u]\n", ui);
       3:) _printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
       4:) _printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
```
